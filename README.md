I have created a simple restaurant tip calculator in React.

It allows you to input the price of the meal and the number of people in the party and work out the collective tip accordingly as well as work out how much each person owes for the tip.

Once the number of guests is input into the form this will prompt each person in the party to input how satisfied they were with the meal and service (select 0%, 5%, 10% and 20%) and this will apply a percentage to the cost of the meal as a tip. If someone changes their mind on their satisfaction percentage the app will adjust accordingly.
Once all satisfaction percentages are input the total tip will be calculated and divided evenly by the number of guests.
The final output is total collective cost of the meal including the final tip and the amount each person needs to pay for their share of the food and the tip.
